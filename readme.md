# kasserole
Docs/tour-of kasserole - my dream/ideal (and so far, also fake) compiled lang, made up from bits and pieces from other languages I like.

```cpp
fun main() {
    #print("Hello World!"); // prints "Hello World!"
}
```

Don't expect anything other than just syntax exploration here!

# compiler???
It shall exist at <https://github.com/Dreamykass/chilimak>, but I can't guarantee it would ever get anywhere near completion.
Chilimak really just a fun side-side-side-project (where kasserole is just a fun side-side-project).
